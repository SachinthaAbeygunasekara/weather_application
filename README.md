## API Integration

The app connects to a weather API to retrieve live weather data based on user location or input. If you want to try this with a specific API (like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI), you'll need to:

1. Sign up for an API key from the provider's website.
2. Include this API key in the JavaScript code in `script.js` where the API call is made.

Make sure to follow the API documentation for any specific requirements or limitations.

## Future Enhancements

- **Extended Forecast**: Add a 5- or 7-day weather forecast feature.
- **Weather Metrics**: Display additional metrics like wind speed, humidity, and sunrise/sunset times.
- **Multiple Languages**: Support for multiple languages for a broader audience.
- **Improved UI**: Potential to include themes or customization options for users.
